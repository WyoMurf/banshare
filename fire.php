// This script is intended to be used for you to open incoming ports
// in your firewall for the server to listen on.

// This script is in PHP, but you can revise to any scripting language
// you desire. 

// At this moment, the server is the only one the Makefile will include
// this firewall script in, and run it. If you need to open even outgoing
// ports with client installs, you may have to revise the Makefile and
// have it include and run a script similar to this in the install-client.sh script.

// I suggest some code at the beginning to remove old firewall rules, as
// you may have done a "make regen" and changed the ports your server
// listens to.

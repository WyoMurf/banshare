## arg1 is the jail
## arg2 is the ip
## arg3 is the program generating the block

## this script is for the !#%$*^!*#@ 0.8.4 (and some greater) versions of fail2ban,
## where the banip command doesn't work unless you call it N times, where n is the 
## max tries for the jail, and then touch the logfile. Wow.

If you cannot just update fail2ban to a late model version,
then you may have to customize this script to work in your environment.
